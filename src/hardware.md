- Why it's important: Allows precise control of motor speed and direction

### 5. DC Motors (x2)

- Function: Provide movement for the car
- Specifications: 3-6V DC motors (exact specifications may vary)
- Why it's important: Convert electrical energy into mechanical motion

### 6. Wheels (x2)

- Function: Allow the car to move smoothly on surfaces
- Specifications: Compatible with your chosen DC motors and chassis
- Why it's important: Provide traction and determine the car's movement capabilities

### 7. Car Chassis

- Function: Serves as the body of the car
- Specifications: Suitable for a two-wheel drive setup
- Why it's important: Provides structure and houses all components

### 8. 9V Batteries (x2)

- Function: Power source for the car and controller
- Specifications: Standard 9V alkaline or rechargeable batteries
- Why it's important: Provides portable power for both the car and controller

## Tools You'll Need

- Soldering iron and solder
- Wire strippers
- Screwdriver set
- Multimeter

## Safety Precautions

- Always disconnect power before making changes to your circuit
- Wear safety glasses when soldering
- Work in a well-ventilated area
- Be cautious of sharp edges on the chassis

## Sourcing Components

You can find most of these components at electronics stores or online retailers. Here are some tips:

- Look for Arduino starter kits that might include some of the required components
- Ensure the NRF24L01 modules are compatible with your Arduino
- Double-check motor specifications to ensure they're suitable for your chassis
