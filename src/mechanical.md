## Mechanical Assembly

Welcome to the mechanical assembly phase of our DIY Wireless Arduino Car project. In this section, we'll put together the physical structure of our car, including the chassis, motors, and wheels.

## Required Components and Tools

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

### Components

- Acrylic chassis plates (top and bottom)
- 4 TT motors
- 4 wheels compatible with TT motors
- Screws, nuts, and spacers (sizes depend on your specific acrylic plates)
- Double-sided tape or mounting putty

### Tools

- Screwdriver (Phillips head)
- Pliers
- Ruler or measuring tape
- Marker or pencil
- Safety goggles

## Assembly Steps

### 1. Prepare the Chassis Plates

1. Carefully remove the protective film from both acrylic plates.
2. Inspect the plates for any pre-drilled holes. If there are none, you'll need to mark and drill them in the next steps.

### 2. Mount the TT Motors

1. Place the bottom chassis plate on your work surface.
2. Position the four TT motors on the corners of the bottom plate. Ensure they're aligned symmetrically.
3. Mark the mounting holes for each motor.
4. If your plate isn't pre-drilled, carefully drill holes for the motor mounts. Always wear safety goggles when drilling.
5. Secure each motor to the bottom plate using screws and nuts.

### 3. Attach the Wheels

1. Once the motors are securely mounted, attach a wheel to each motor shaft.
2. Ensure the wheels are firmly attached and can rotate freely.

### 4. Prepare Mounting Points for Electronics

1. On the top plate, mark areas where you'll mount the Arduino, breadboard, and other components.
2. If using screws for mounting, drill appropriate holes. If using double-sided tape or putty, clean the areas thoroughly.

### 5. Assemble the Chassis

1. Use spacers to create a gap between the top and bottom plates. This space will house our electronics.
2. Align the top plate over the bottom plate and secure them together using screws and spacers at the corners.
3. Ensure all screws are tight, but be careful not to over-tighten and crack the acrylic.

## Final Checks

1. Verify that all four wheels touch the ground and spin freely.
2. Check that there's adequate space between the plates for your electronic components.
3. Ensure all screws are securely fastened.
4. Gently test the sturdiness of your assembly by lifting and tilting the chassis.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've completed the mechanical assembly of your DIY Wireless Arduino Car. The chassis is now ready for the electronic components.

In the next section, we'll move on to the [Electrical Assembly](/electrical/), where we'll wire up the motors and prepare to add our control components.

If you encounter any issues during assembly or have questions, don't hesitate to check the [FAQ](/faq/) or reach out for help. Remember, precision in this stage will make the next steps much smoother. Happy building!
