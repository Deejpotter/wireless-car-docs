## Welcome to My DIY Wireless Arduino Car Project

Hello and welcome! I'm excited to share my journey of building a wireless Arduino-controlled car. This project is born out of my passion for engineering and desire to learn through hands-on experience. By documenting my process, I hope to provide a valuable resource for other enthusiasts who might want to undertake similar projects.

## Project Overview

This DIY project combines embedded systems programming, wireless communication, and motor control to create a remotely operated vehicle. It's a fun way to apply engineering principles and explore various technologies in a practical setting.

## Key Components

- **Chassis**: Custom-built using acrylic plates
- **Motors**: 4 TT motors for propulsion
- **Microcontroller**: Arduino Uno R3
- **Wireless Communication**: NRF24L01 2.4GHz Transceiver
- **Motor Control**: L293D Dual H-Bridge Motor Driver
- **User Interface**: Funduino Joystick Shield
- **Power Management**: 9V batteries with voltage regulation

## Project Structure

This project is documented across several pages, each focusing on a specific aspect of the build:

1. [**Home**](/): (You are here!): Project overview and introduction.
2. [**Mechanical Assembly**](/assembly/): Assembling the chassis, motors, and wheels.
3. [**Electrical Assembly**](/electrical): Connecting the electronics and wiring the components.
4. [**Software Setup**](/software): Programming the Arduino for wireless control.
5. [**Integration & Testing**](/integration): Bringing everything together and testing the car.
6. [**Operation Manual**](/operation): Instructions for using and maintaining the car.
7. [**FAQ**](/faq): Answers to common questions about the project.

## Prerequisites

While I'll do my best to explain everything in detail, this project will be easier if you have some familiarity with:

- Basic electronics and circuit design
- Arduino programming (or general C++ knowledge)
- Simple mechanical assembly
- Use of common tools (screwdriver, pliers, etc.)

Don't worry if you're not an expert in all these areas, I'll guide you through the process step by step.

## Let's Get Started

I'm thrilled to share this journey with you. Whether you're here to build your own car, learn about the technologies involved, or just curious about the process, I hope you'll find this documentation helpful and inspiring.

Once you're ready, let's dive into the [Mechanical Assembly](/assembly/) and start building our wireless Arduino car!
